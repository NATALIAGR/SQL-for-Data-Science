# SQL-for-Data-Science
This is the final project I've done for completion of the great course on SQL "SQL for Data Science" by University of California, Prof. Sadie St. Lawrence .
My repo is intended to be a fieldtrip through the process of managing and analysing data in SQL language. 

In this assigment I used a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.
The goal in the first part of the assignment was to profile and better understand the data.Later on, in the second part of the assignment, I had to formulate my own question for analysis and prepare a dataset for the analysis I choose to do.
Overall, I had to write a variety of SQL statements learnt during the course and Im sharing them here.
